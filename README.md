# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data using various machine learning and statistical techniques, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Time Series Analysis. The primary goal is to understand the trends, predict future cases, and classify data to assist in making informed decisions based on COVID-19 statistics.
### Objectives
1. *Linear Regression*: To model and predict the continuous outcome of COVID-19 cases based on various features.
2. *Logistic Regression*: To classify binary outcomes, such as predicting the probability of a certain event occurring (e.g., whether a region will experience a significant rise in cases).
3. *Time Series Analysis*: To analyze the temporal patterns and trends in COVID-19 data, forecast future cases, and assess the impact of interventions over time.
## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes COVID-19 statistics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other related metrics. The data can be sourced from publicly available datasets provided by health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), Johns Hopkins University, or government health departments.
## Project Structure
1. *Data Preprocessing*: 
   - Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering.
2. *Linear Regression Analysis*:
   - Objective: Predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on various features (e.g., population density, previous cases).
   - Model Building: Implement linear regression using scikit-learn.
   - Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
3. *Logistic Regression Analysis*:
   - Objective: Classify binary outcomes related to COVID-19 data (e.g., high vs. low risk).
   - Model Building: Implement logistic regression using scikit-learn.
   - Evaluation: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

4. *Time Series Analysis*:
   - Objective: Analyze and forecast the temporal patterns of COVID-19 cases.
   - Methods: Apply techniques such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Prophet.
   - Evaluation: Assess the forecast accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Usage
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Run the script preprocess_data.py to clean and prepare the data.
2. *Linear Regression*: Execute linear_regression.py to build and evaluate the linear regression model.
3. *Logistic Regression*: Run logistic_regression.py for the logistic regression analysis and classification tasks.
4. *Time Series Analysis*: Execute time_series_analysis.py to analyze and forecast COVID-19 trends.
## Conclusion
This project provides insights into COVID-19 data through the application of different analytical techniques. By employing Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Time Series Analysis, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing COVID-19 trends, the ability to classify risk levels, and forecasts for future case counts. This analysis is crucial for public health planning and response strategies.
Future work may involve expanding the dataset, incorporating additional features, or exploring more advanced models to enhance predictive accuracy and classification performance.
